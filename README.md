    #My professional Website#

This is my first Website project with Microverse. And this is version 1 of the mobile version of the site. In the process of creating this site I will :

1. set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
2. build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using the template you chose in the previous step.

**Objectives:**

1. Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
2. Flexbox to place elements in the page.
3. Build a personal portfolio site.
4. Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

**Getting Started**

The first step in setting up this project in setting up your lintors. After that you can go to Figma and find a template and then use your HTML and CSS
to design your site. Good luck!
